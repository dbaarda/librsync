/** Simple hashtable.
 *
 * This is a minimal hashtable containing pointers to arbitrary
 * entries with configurable hashtable size and support for custom
 * hash() and cmp() methods. The cmp() method can either be a simple
 * comparison between two keys, or can be against a special match
 * object containing additional mutable state. This allows for things
 * like deferred and cached evaluation of costly comparison data.
 * The hash() function doesn't need to avoid clustering behaviour.
 *
 * It uses open addressing with quadratic probing for collisions. The
 * MurmurHash3 finalization function is used on the hash() output to
 * avoid clustering. There is no support for removing entries, only
 * adding them. Multiple entries with the same key can be added, and
 * you can use a fancy cmp() function to find particular entries by
 * more than just their key. There is an iterator for iterating
 * through all entries in the hashtable.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *   typedef ... key_t;
 *   int key_hash(const key_t *e);
 *   int key_cmp(key_t *e, const key_t *o);
 *
 *   typedef struct entry {
 *     key_t key;  // Inherit from key_t.
 *     ...extra entry value data...
 *   } entry_t;
 *   void entry_init(entry_t *e, ...);
 *
 *   hashtable_t t;
 *   entry_t entries[300];
 *   key_t k;
 *   entry_t *e;
 *
 *   hashtable_init(&t, 300, &key_hash, &key_cmp);
 *   entry_init(&entries[5], ...);
 *   hashtable_add(&t, &entries[5]);
 *   k = ...;
 *   e = hashtable_find(&t, &k);
 *
 *   hashtable_iter i;
 *   for (e = hashtable_iter(&i, &t); e != NULL; e = hashtable_next(&i))
 *     ...
 *
 * The hash() and cmp() fuctions will typically take pointers to
 * key/entry instances the same as the pointers stored in the
 * hashtable. However it is also possible for them to take "match
 * objects" that are a "subclass" of the entry type that contain
 * additional state for complicated comparision operations.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *   typedef struct match {
 *     key_t key;  // Inherit from key_t;
 *     ...extra match criteria and state data...
 *   } match_t;
 *   int match_cmp(match_t *m, const entry_t *e);
 *
 *   ...
 *   match_t m;
 *
 *   hashtable_init(&t, 300, &key_hash, &match_cmp);
 *   ...
 *   m = ...;
 *   e = hashtable_find(&t, &m);
 *
 * The cmp() function is only called for finding hashtable entries
 * and can mutate the match_t object for doing things like deferred
 * and cached evaluation of expensive match data. It can also access
 * the whole entry_t object to match against more than just the key. */
